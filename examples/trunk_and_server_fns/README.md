# Leptos Todo App Without SSR

This is a minimal example of how to use Leptos' server functions without using Server Side Rendering or cargo-leptos.

To run the app, first start the server.

```
cargo run --features=server
```

Then use [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) to build and serve the web assets:

```
trunk serve
```
